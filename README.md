# Website_2018
Our new updated website designed to run on an EC2 and loosely based on 2017's website

As like any other nodejs based website to run this 

Install Node.js, clone the repo and then run:

```
npm install  //installs the packages you need

npm start    //starts the server locally on port 3000
```

This will be hosted on a free EC2 hosted by Kenny Shaw on lightninginspace.ga.
